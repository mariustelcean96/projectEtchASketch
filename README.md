TOP Project: a browser version of a mix between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch
This project should test my DOM manipulation skills. 
It should involve: 
1) creating fixed sized divs with JS and inserting them in an already created container
2) adding hover event listeners for each contained div
3) on hovering over, a div should change it's backgrground color propery value to a random/predefined value

By the end of this project I should have a deeper understanding of how to stack divs in a certain manner and how to manipulate the DOM using JS.
